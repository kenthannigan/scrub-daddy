## Setup
---

Add a file named `private.json` with the following contents one directory outside of the `scrub-daddy` directory:

```
{
    "token": "Insert your discord bot token here.",
    "trnApiKey": "Get a fortnite stats TRN API key from https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api and insert it here",
    "googleUrlApiKey": "Get a Google URL Shortener API key from https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/v1/getting_started#APIKey and insert it here"
}
```

If you need help generating the discord bot token needed to add the bot to your server, use [the guide created by jagrosh](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Adding-Your-Bot-To-Your-Server)

Call `.setup` within the server you added this bot to once that file is created. You can add the api keys later, but the token needs to be added prior to calling `.setup`.
